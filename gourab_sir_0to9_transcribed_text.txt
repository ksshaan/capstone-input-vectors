Aditi ok so this write down the definition of list so will define risk in epidemiology in a very specific way to write in epidemiology in epidemiology of the probability which is the probability that an individual with certain characteristics that individual with certain characteristics se age ladies sex and smoking state
will develop will develop or die from a disease or even generally or even more generally will experience a health status with 
experience of health status changed
interest will experience the status changed of interest over a specified follow-up period specified follow-up period saying that in epidemiology design software defined based upon which is the probability that an individual with certain characteristics will develop or die from a disease or if you'd prefer talking in are even more general sense it will be the error in the probability that an individual with certain characteristics will experience action status change of interest over a specified follow-up period in the talking about that
disease that thing that I have written over there that I am a disease when you talk about dying from a disease your imagination is that the individual does not have the disease at the start of the Polo ok so that individuals who were following ok se did not have the disease at the start of the follow and did not die from any other causes to the following so and individual does not have the disease
the start of the follow-up and does not die from any other cause during the follow-up adamson right so we see that we are making a donation to make things simple for us to calculate we want to tell the probability of you want to calculate the probability that a person is gold developer disease given the person has been exposed so that's what we calculate so ok if this is a raised you know that if if
outcome is abbreviated as if the exposure is abbreviated as he saw the risk is basically the probability of getting the outcome given the exposure condition of the best for difficult to calculate but then we are saying that that every people you started with so if this is the time that we started with your that few people this once it is one this person this person would assume that none of them will have the disease of start the following ok don't happen that person enters the study with the disease ok so we are not allow any person to get inside the study what do they have the disease and then we are saying that as we keep following is person over to
three years previous 10 years 20 years ok and in the person die is a person dies only because of that disease it is time for some other reason may be because of you know that some accident or something ok sir may be due to Heart Attack then that becomes a problem in of beer making the assumption that the person cannot die ok so this managers for to connect to something that I have already learnt with something and learning you can just talking about best infrastructure status now if this happens ok 
so if the order of this person ok so say that from India moved out to say China ok and so person to China then there is no you can follow this person that I have no idea that would have
this person after that ok hand people learnt hardest on this disc and of Thrones call century it so the sensing Soham to bring the sensors in the picture ok so I'm not bringing censoring into the picture ok so we will assume that there is no censoring 
because if their winning sensing the rest will be a measure of the survival functions which have a lot in thermal analysis a prospective study ok the current definition applies to prospective study notes that identification by Harman and we will see later in this session today that we actually cannot calculate the risk
retrospective study is not working with is no way that we can I should do that because it's hard to spectacles moving backward like increase control studies we cannot calculate reached ok so now we're talking about breast when describing this kit is necessary for a specified period of follow-up visits for the period of the risk period without the trees at the describing this 
becomes
complete ok sir describing which becomes incomplete so what do you mean by so when I say that you know that you know what is the release what is the least that of a 50 year old male will develop prostate cancer so what is the risk
